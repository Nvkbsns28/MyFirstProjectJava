# Calculator Program

This is a simple Java program that calculates the net income of a business based on its income and expenses.

The total income is calculated as $5405. The program then prompts the user to enter the staff expenses and other expenses. These values are subtracted from the total income to calculate the net income, which is then displayed to the user.
